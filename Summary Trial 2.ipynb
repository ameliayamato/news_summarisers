      "On one hand are traditional wealth managers, firms like Edward Jones, who either employ full-time human financial advisors or empower independent contractors to help clients plan through their finances. Financial advisors already rely on a suite of software from CRMs to investment analysis platforms to perform their jobs, but those tools have rarely been integrated into one place. On the other side has been the rise of “roboadvisors” like Wealthfront  that use algorithms and simple financial products like ETFs to advise people at lower cost. They believe that wealth advisors have special knowledge of their clients needs and the relationships to match, which Vise can’t compete with. As millions of baby boomers leave their jobs in the coming years and transition into retirement, there is a huge competition for who will manage their savings. \n",
